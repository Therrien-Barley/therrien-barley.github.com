		  	<p>Five architectural firms were invited to develop new visions for the future of urban life using Manhattan as their muse and testing ground. In partnership with the New Museum, the exhibition took the form of a massive scale model of Manhattan which presented the five future scenarios.</p>
		  	<p>As part of the Audi Urban Future Initiative the project took place within the scope of the Festival of Ideas for the New City, an event held by the New Museum in New York from 4 to 8 May. Over the course of the exhibition, the firms worked both individually and collectively to develop new ideas and future visions of mobility which were presented in a panel discussion. Visitors to the gallery were digitally inserted into the architects' renderings of the future that were then posted to Facebook as part of the digital presence of the exhibition.</p>
