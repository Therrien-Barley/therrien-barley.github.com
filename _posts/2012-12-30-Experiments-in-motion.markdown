		  	<p>Experiments in Motion is a research initiative partnering Audi of America and Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, for a research think tank, architectural design studios, and exhibition - challenging both partners to rethink motion, think differently about mobility, and work together to imagine future cities.</p>
		  	<p>As part of the Audi Urban Future Initiative, Experiments in Motion is a research component in a world wide network that seeks to bring together experts from within Audi with architects, planners, and visionaries.The research and designs generated by Experiments in Motion were exhibited within a fifty foot floating model of Manhattan, researched with the help of the MTA, the DOT, and the Center for Urban Real Estate (CURE). The suspended model of Manhattan’s subway grid contextualizes the student designs within the city’s huge inventory of underground spaces - a never-before-seen view of every subway station on the island.</p>
